Welcome to this ‘repo’
================

## What is this?

This is a Github repo, an online place to keep and share code. I have it
connected to the RStudio app on my local computer, so all changes I make
in the scripts for this unit can be easily synced with the online
version.

Github is useful - but it is not at all essential to use it when you
work in R. For example, I have been using R for 15 years and only
started using Github this year. We don’t have time to discuss Github in
this class, but if you’re ever interested, you will find plenty of
introductions to Github and the combination with RStudio, for example
[this one](https://r-bio.github.io/intro-git-rstudio/). For now, I am
only using it to get some information to you.

Your first view of this document is as a web page. If you click on the
“View on Github” button above, you’ll see the regular Github view,
which shows you all the other files in the project.

## Working with Twitter data

The most important thing here is the PDF document showing the steps we
need to take to first harvest and then analyze tweets. You can download
the PDF [here](analyzing_twitter_data.pdf).
